Name of Project:
NeuroSpace

Project's Purpose or Goal: The goal of NeuroSpace is to create a platform tailored specifically for neurodivergent individuals and their loved ones. I hope to craft an intuitive and inclusive networking app that cultivates a supportive community, facilitates information sharing, and meaningful connections. I love the idea of offering a space where people can find assistance, guidance and camaraderie.
